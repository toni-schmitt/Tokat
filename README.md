# Tokat
A simple weather API to demonstrate the capabilities of different AI Tools for the Jungle Academy on 13.10.2023

## The Demo Application - Introduction
This is the best selling service "Tokat" of "Greedy Solutions Enterprise", a simple weather api that provides the current temparature and a "Feels-Like™"-temperature in °C. Scrooge McDuck, the CEO, wants to keep operating prices as low as possible and therfore only used a free tier of the OpenWeatherMap-API. Until now that was not a problem, our customers never hit the limit of the free tier, but recently we saw a big spike in usage and the limit of the free tier was hit almost every day. Scrooge explicitly stated that we are not allowed to upgrade our tier. We should rather, to tackle to problem, use another weather provider's free tier whenever we hit our limit. Gladstone Gander was tasked with that implementation and he could almost finish it until he sadly got sick. Now you, Donald Duck, are tasked to complete the implementation of your rival and cousin, Gladstone. Sadly you do not know much about programming, but you have to give your best to finally show everyone that you are better then your cousin. Gladstone left you a little [note](https://github.com/toni-schmitt/Tokat/blob/3f8b182df0666172a7a079a64c259b753dc86fa9/src/Weather/Tokat.Weather.Api/TASK.md) to help you get started. There is little hope in sight, but you might have a chance to complete the task using AI and the note from gladstone.
